  <h2 class="top">The Golden State Warriors ascended from lovable losers to one of the most dominant stretches of basketball the NBA has ever seen. This is the story of how it all happened.</h2>

      <h2>We Believe</h2>
      <article class="content"><p>The Warriors franchise was synonymous with losing for decades. The team was known for playing a fun, all-offense style of basketball, that rarely translated into success when the final buzzer sounded. Going into the 2006-2007 season they owned the NBA’s longest active playoff drought (13 years), and the team spent most of the year mired in mediocrity until a massive midseason trade shook things up. The Warriors and Indiana Pacers swapped eight total players, with the Warriors shipping Mike Dunleavy and Troy Murphy to Indiana, and the Pacers sending Al Harrington and volatile-yet-talented Stephen Jackson back in return. Jackson and Harrington fit in to the starting lineup seamlessly, teaming with star guards Baron Davis and Jason Richardson and center Andris Biedrins to form a ruthless up-tempo offensive attack. Once all pieces began to mesh, the trade propelled the Warriors to a 16-5 record to end the regular season, winning nine of their final ten games and securing the West’s 8th and final playoff seed, along with the collective hearts of the Bay Area fans, who’d grown all too accustomed to missing out on the playoffs.</p>
        <p>The strong finish to the season set the stage for a historic playoff run. Golden State was matched up with MVP Dirk Nowitzki and the top-seeded Dallas Mavericks, the reigning Western Conference champions and winners of 67 games during the regular season. The 25 game disparity in win totals belied significant matchup problems the Warriors caused against the heavily-favorited Mavericks, however. Golden State won the opening game in Dallas, grabbing the attention of the rest of the league. After ceding Game 2, the Warriors won Games 3 and 4 in Oakland, taking a commanding 3-1 series lead, and eventually closed things out in 6 games. They became the first 8 seed ever to upset a 1 seed in a best-of-seven playoff series, cementing the “We Believe” Warriors’ place in the record books.</p>
        <p>Round 2 of the playoffs brought an end to the Warriors’ Cinderella story. The team ran into a strong, veteran Utah Jazz squad boasting the likes of Deron Williams, Carlos Boozer and Andrei Kirilenko. Golden State was clearly overmatched, getting eliminated in 5 games, though not before creating one of the most enjoyable playoff moments in Bay Area history.</p>

      <h2>Rebuild</h2>
      <article class="content"> <p>The 2006-07 Warriors finished the regular season with a 42-40 record, snapping a streak of twelve consecutive losing seasons. The 2007-08 team improved by 6 games, to finish with a 48-34 record, which, in a typical season, would be more than sufficient to clinch a spot in the playoffs. But that year, 8 teams in the Western Conference won 50 or more games, leaving the Warriors on the outside of the playoffs, looking in. 2008 would be the last winning season for some time for the Warriors, and the once-promising core crumbled, thrusting Golden State back into rebuilding mode. </p>
        <p>Longtime Warriors stalwart Jason Richardson was traded prior to the 2007-08 season. Team leader Baron Davis moved south in the summer of 2008, signing with the Los Angeles Clippers. Stephen Jackson, unhappy with his role and the direction of the team, demanded a trade the following fall. The team complied, having also traded away Al Harrington just weeks prior to trading Jackson. And fan-favorite Monta Ellis was traded for injury-prone center Andrew Bogut in 2012. In the four seasons from 2008 to 2012, the Warriors won just 37% of their games, never coming close to making the playoffs, as team and fan morale cratered. But the four-year run of misery was not completely void of bright spots. </p>
        <p>New ownership purchased the Warriors in 2010, offering new hope to the team and fan base. All Star free agent David Lee agreed to a sign-and trade deal to come to Golden State, bringing the team its first marquee free agent in years. Former NBA star Mark Jackson was brought on to coach in 2011. And the team had one of the better stretches of drafts in the league. Future NBA Defensive Player of the Year Draymond Green was drafted in 2012. Future All-Star guard Klay Thompson was drafted in 2011. And a slender guard by the name of Steph Curry was drafted back in 2009. Establishment of a strong foundation was underway; just how strong it would be, was yet to be seen. </p>

      <h2>Rise Up</h2>
      <article class="content"> <p>The 2012-13 season brought the Warriors to new heights, and glimpses of the team’s true ceiling began to emerge. Along with Green, 2012’s draft delivered Harrison Barnes and Festus Ezeli, all three of whom played valuable minutes in their rookie seasons. Coach Jackson established defensive principles the team had sorely lacked for years. Thompson started every game and began to emerge as a lethal shooter. And Curry, whose early career was marred by ankle injuries, remained healthy for the entire season and began to showcase his enormous potential. He led the team to 47 wins and the 6th seed in the West playoffs. </p>
        <p>Recapturing some of the 2007 team’s magic, the Warriors upset the 3rd seeded Denver Nuggets in the first round, propelling the team back into the national spotlight behind inspired play from Curry. Steph’s ankle troubles returned in the next round, though, and the team succumbed to the San Antonio Spurs in 6 games. But the team had leveled up. That offseason, talented two-way wing Andre Iguodala, formerly of the Warriors’ first-round foil Nuggets, signed with Golden State as a free agent. Once a basketball wasteland, devoid of talent, the Warriors’ roster now boasted five recent or future All Stars (Lee, Iguodala, Curry, Thompson, Green) and a mostly-healthy former number 1 overall draft pick in Bogut.</p>
        <p>In 2013-14, the Warriors reached the 50-win plateau in the regular season, for the first time in 20 years. Iguodala meshed extremely well with the rest of the team, and Curry, Thompson, and Green all improved from the previous season. Despite all of that, the team lost in seven games to the rival Los Angeles Clippers in the first round of the playoffs. Jackson was fired by the team’s owner, due to philosophical differences, and the team headed into the offseason with a somewhat murky future. </p>

        <h2>Championship!</h2>
        <article class="content"> <p>Three personnel decisions in the summer and fall of 2014 paved the way for brilliance, putting in place the final steps on Golden State’s path to the top of the NBA hierarchy. The first was replacing Mark Jackson as coach, with Steve Kerr, who had played on 5 championship teams during his playing days, and was the most sought-after coaching candidate of the summer. Kerr would build on Jackson’s defensive strategies, installing “switch everything” tactics to make life extremely challenging for opposing offenses. He also installed a fast-paced, motion offense, that spread the floor and consistently produced great scoring opportunities for the team’s potent shooters. </p>
          <p>The second decision was Kerr convincing Iguodala not to start, instead to anchor the bench unit. Iguodala’s veteran savvy and leadership skills provided immeasurable value to the Warriors’ reserves, and Harrison Barnes provided capable play with the starters in Iguodala’s stead. The third decision was born out of necessity. A preseason hamstring injury to David Lee left a vacancy in the starting lineup, which would be filled by Draymond Green. </p>
          <p>Green’s play and Kerr’s new system brought the team to new heights, aided by continued growth from Curry and Thompson. They spent most of the season with the best record in the NBA, finishing with 67 wins and the top overall seed in the playoffs. Curry was named NBA MVP, after leading the team to its best record ever. And the postseason was just as successful, as the Warriors capped off a dominant season by defeating LeBron James’ Cleveland Cavaliers in the NBA Finals, bringing Golden State its first championship in 40 seasons. </p>

          <h2>73-9, 131-0, 3-1</h2>
          <article class="content"> <p>Many teams suffer a “championship hangover” in the season immediately after winning the title. Not these Warriors. They raced out of the gate, playing like they had to prove their greatness to the world, and won their first 24 consecutive games, setting the record for longest winning streak to start a season. The strong start was all the more notable because the team was without the services of Coach Kerr, who missed the first 43 games recovering from back surgery complications. In total, the Warriors went 39-4 without their head coach, and began eyeing a record once thought unbreakable – the most regular season wins, 72. This record was held by the 1995-96 Chicago Bulls, a team that featured Steve Kerr coming off the bench, in addition to a man by the name of Michael Jordan. </p>
            <p>The Warriors stayed hot all season, nabbing win 73 on the last night of the regular season and establishing the new record for best regular season, at 73-9. Along the way, they captured the eyes of the nation, providing thrilling victories night in and night out. Curry followed up his MVP campaign with one of the best offensive seasons in NBA history. He obliterated the NBA record for most 3 pointers made in a single season (which he held from the previous season), averaged 30 points per game, and produced an endless supply of highlight-reel moments. Curry won MVP again that season, becoming the first player to do so unanimously, receiving all 131 first place votes. </p>
            <p>While the regular season was dominated by Golden State, the postseason was a different story. The Warriors won each of the first two series 4-1, but the road became much rockier. Curry hurt his ankle in the first game of the playoffs, and his knee in the fifth game. Despite playing through both injuries, he had lost a step from his MVP form. In the Western Conference Finals, the Warriors went down 3-1 to the Thunder, before battling back to win in 7 games and reach their second consecutive NBA Finals, against LeBron and co., again. There, they would take a commanding 3-1 lead over Cleveland, only to blow that lead, much as the Thunder had against them, and lose in 7 games to the Cavaliers. This set the stage for endless jokes and mocking across the NBA community, but also paved the way for the biggest prize of the offseason…</p>

            <h2>Back on Top!</h2>
            <article class="content"> <p>On the morning of July 4th, 2016, after months of rumors and speculation, Kevin Durant announced that he was leaving he Thunder in free agency to sign with the Warriors. Despite turning over half of the previous season’s roster in order to facilitate the signing, adding Durant to a core that included Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, Draymond Green and Andre Iguodala (and that had just completed the winningest regular season in NBA history) gave the Warriors one of the most talented rosters ever assembled. </p>
              <p>On paper, the team was now prohibitive favorites to reach the NBA Finals for the third consecutive season. The only matter up for debate, was how long it would take Durant to fit in with his new teammates. The answer, it turned out, was not long. After a couple of early-season losses, one in blowout fashion at the hands of the Spurs, and another to the talent-starved Lakers, the Warriors righted the ship and cruised through most of the rest of the season. Despite an injury in late-February that caused Durant to miss nearly a quarter of the season and a few playoff games, the Warriors finished 67-15, setting a record for the winningest three-season stretch in NBA history.</p>
              <p>The Warriors cut through the regular season like a hot knife through butter, and made the playoffs look even easier. They became the first team to sweep the first three best-of-seven series of the playoffs, and met the Cavs in the Finals for a third year in a row. And they took the first three Finals games, to run their playoff winning streak to a record 15 games, before finally losing Game 4 and bringing the series to an all-too-familiar 3-1 margin. But there would be no blown lead this time, as the Warriors took a lead in the second quarter of Game 5 that they would not give back, eventually winning 129-120 and capturing their second NBA title in 3 years. In the weeks following the season, the Warriors re-signed every key member of their championship team, ensuring that, for the foreseeable future, any discussion of the best team in the NBA would begin and end with Golden State.</p>
